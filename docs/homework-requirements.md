# UBIQUITI FRONTEND WEB DEVELOPER TEST ASSIGNMENT

[<- Back](../README.md)

## Goal

Create a web application that would allow Ubiquiti employees to explore, find, look up
and share information about all the Ubiquiti devices, exposed by our public device
database `{path}/public.json` and matching our design

## Approach

- Build it for production. As if you had to ship it to all UI employees, with assistance
  from DevOPS
- Consider the design as unfinished. Fill in the blanks where you see the need
- Fail gracefully. Be aware that the API can fail or change at various levels
- Prioritize what you consider most important and/or your strongest skills. But list the
  remaining work as notes for whoever would take over to drive it to the finish line

### Practicalities

- Open the attached file in Figma
- Image urls can be constructed using the device ID and resolutions - e.g.
  `{assets}/{id}_257x257.png`

## Requirements

- TypeScript
- React
- “Works on my machine”
